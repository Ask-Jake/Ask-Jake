Hi, everyone. My name is Jacob. 

I am a cybersecurity-focused student with hands-on experience in security labs and coursework covering network security, threat detection, vulnerability management, incident response fundamentals, and security operations concepts.<br/>

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and Cybersecurity at Wright State University, maintaining a 3.5 GPA,  while aligning learning with SOC-relevant tools, frameworks, and certification objectives.<br/>

I have strong analytical and troubleshooting skills with experience in reviewing logs, identifying anomalous behavior, documenting findings, and applying security best practices in simulated and real-world scenarios.<br/>

I am actively developing skills for SOC and cybersecurity intern roles, with a focused interest in SIEM analysis, cloud security fundamentals, automation, and continuous learning through labs, projects, and certifications.
